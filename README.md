Joinees get a simple guided flow from upload to download. 😊

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create `.env` from [`.env.example`](./.env.example) and replace sample values.
Never commit `.env` files. For GitHub Actions, use
[`.env.ci.example`](./.env.ci.example) as a safe reference and add the real
values as secrets in the `FirstDay` GitHub environment. 🔐

## 🚢 GitHub Actions Setup

Create a `FirstDay` environment under **Settings → Environments**, then add
these environment secrets before running CI or deployments:

| Secret                                 | Required For                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Browser-safe Supabase access |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`             | Supabase project endpoint    |

| Workflow                                                                       | Trigger                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [CI](https://github.com/Moleesh/FirstDay/actions/workflows/ci.yml)             | Pushes to `main`, pull requests, and manual runs |
| [Pages](https://github.com/Moleesh/FirstDay/actions/workflows/pages.yml)       | Pushes to `main` and manual runs                 |
| [Security](https://github.com/Moleesh/FirstDay/actions/workflows/security.yml) | Daily at 03:00 UTC and manual runs               |

CI validates environment variables, linting, formatting, TypeScript, unit tests,
dependency audit results, committed secrets, the production build, and
Playwright flows before a change is considered ready. The web e2e job installs
Chromium in CI before running Playwright so browser binaries stay in sync with
the pinned test runner.

Unit coverage includes authentication helpers, session state, route guards,
appearance preferences, onboarding drafts, recruiter invitations, joinee
assignments, document delivery actions, template-building flows, and shared UI
utilities.

Database schema changes live in [`supabase/migrations`](./supabase/migrations).
Apply them through the Supabase dashboard or Supabase CLI before deploying
features that use new tables.

The published GitHub Pages build currently provides trial onboarding flows.
Production writes should be implemented through RLS-protected Supabase calls or
Supabase Edge Functions before accepting real onboarding documents.

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Keep local values in `.env` and deployment values in GitHub Actions. 🔐
- Trial credentials are for development reviews only.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Create a focused branch.
2. Keep source files below 200 lines where practical.
3. Add tests for behavior changes.
4. Run formatting, linting, type checks, tests, and builds before pushing.
5. Confirm that no secrets were committed.
